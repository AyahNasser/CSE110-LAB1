### Interests
*Throughout my Computer Engineering studies at UCSD, I discovered that I have enjoyed my electrical engineering classes more than my computer science classes. I have found myself more passionate and interested in the electrical engineering classes topics, such as signal processing and circuit design. 
Despite this, I do not regret doing computer engineering at UCSD since it has taught me more about myself and opened my eyes to what I like and what I do not.*
